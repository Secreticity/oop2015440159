Class
 - Function : Methods
 - Structures : Field

Encapsulation
 - Show only necessary info to other classes/packages

Inheritance
 - VERY POWERFUL
 - inherit all fields and methods
 - choose/select needed-only field/methods from mother packages
 - KEY: REUSE

Polymorphism
 - Upcasting / Downcasting
  ( xx.eat() runs at the LAST step - when running the whole program )
  ( depends on "xx", methods are fixed after instance determination )
  ( Dog eats vs Cat eats. -> Different method call )
 - polymorphism : same name, but different shape

 - static / dynamic
